# IQ Link - Device Data Collection Platform

IQ Link is a centralized device management platform designed for collecting, monitoring, and analyzing data from devices connected via TCP/IP. It's particularly focused on managing devices that perform lipemic tests on blood donations.

## Features

### Dashboard
- Real-time system status monitoring
- Quick access to key metrics (donations, devices, users)
- System uptime tracking

### Device Management
- Automatic registration of devices on first connection
- Device activity monitoring
- Device configuration and settings management
- Serial number updates
- Request and apply device setup changes

### Donation Data Management
- View and filter donation records
- Real-time data updates
- Advanced data export with customizable formats
- Track lipemic test results (values, groups, status)

### User Management
- Role-based authentication (Admin/User roles)
- User profile management
- Secure password storage

### System Settings
- Network configuration
- Database connection settings
- Backup and restore functionality

## Technical Details

### Network Communication
- The application acts as a TCP server listening on port 5000
- Devices connect to this port and exchange data using a proprietary protocol
- No need to manually configure IP addresses of remote devices - they automatically connect to the server

### Data Storage
- Uses MySQL database for data persistence
- Supports database backup and restore functionality
- Automatic database migration on startup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 SDK or later
- MySQL Server 5.7 or later

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeviceDataCollector.git
   cd DeviceDataCollector
   ```

2. **Update database connection string:**
   - Open `appsettings.json`
   - Modify the `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` to match your MySQL server settings:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;port=3306;database=devicedata;user=root;password=your_password"
     }
     ```

3. **Build and run the application:**
   ```
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```
   
4. **Access the application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Default login credentials:
     - Admin: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`
     - User: Username: `user`, Password: `user123`

### Configuring TCP Server

By default, the TCP server binds to the IP address specified in `appsettings.json` under `TCPServer:IPAddress` and listens on the port specified in `TCPServer:Port`. The default port is 5000.

```json
"TCPServer": {
  "IPAddress": "192.168.1.130",
  "Port": 5000
}
```

Make sure to set the IP address to one of your machine's network interfaces that the devices can reach.

## Working with Devices

### Device Protocol

The application communicates with devices using a specialized protocol:

1. Devices send status updates (`#S` messages)
2. Devices send data readings (`#D` messages)
3. Server can request buffered data (`#u` messages)
4. Server can update device configuration (`#W` messages)
5. Server can update device serial numbers (`#i` messages)

### Device Setup Mode

To configure a device:
1. Put the device into setup mode (usually through device's interface)
2. The device status will change to "Setup Mode" (Status = 3) in the system
3. Click "Request Setup" button to retrieve current configuration
4. Make desired changes and click "Save Setup" to apply them

## User Guide

### Viewing Donation Data

1. Click on "Donations" in the sidebar
2. Use filters and sorting options to find specific records
3. Click on "Details" for more information about a specific donation

### Exporting Data

1. Navigate to Donations â†’ Export
2. Select desired columns and configure export format
3. Set date range and device filters
4. Click "Export to CSV"
5. Save your export configuration for future use

### Device Management

1. Click on "Devices" in the sidebar
2. View all registered devices and their current status
3. Click on a device to view details and recent readings
4. Use the Edit option to update device information

### System Administration (Admin Only)

1. **User Management:**
   - Create, edit, or delete user accounts
   - Assign Admin or User roles

2. **Network Settings:**
   - Configure TCP server settings
   - View available network interfaces

3. **Database Settings:**
   - Configure database connection
   - Test database connectivity

4. **Backup and Restore:**
   - Create manual or scheduled backups
   - Restore from previous backups

## Troubleshooting

### Device Connection Issues

- Ensure the TCP server IP address is correctly set to your machine's IP
- Verify port 5000 is not blocked by a firewall
- Check that devices are configured to connect to the correct server IP and port

### Database Issues

- Verify MySQL server is running
- Check database connection string in appsettings.json
- Ensure the specified database exists or the user has permission to create it
